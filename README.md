This was another great lesson from Wes Bos's awesome [JavaScript 30 course](http://javascript30.com), which teaches JavaScript fundamental concepts to create cool stuff without using any frameworks or libraries, just vanilla JS.

In this demo, we put together a search form that asks a user to fill in a city or state. When you type in a city or state, a list of results appears below filtered by each letter as you type. Pretty neat. I've always thought this would be a complicated thing to put together, but it was actually more simple that I thought, and I learned a lot here.

Here are the takeaways from this lesson:

1. Fetch API
2. JavaScript Promises
3. The ES6 Array Spread Operator
4. Using JavaScript `RegExp` from a text `input`
5. Listening for different kinds of text input events
